# KOB_RESTAURANT

I  wanted to customize the home page of https://restauranteskob.com/ based on my modern thoughs about design.
I invited two people to share their ideas about the changes that could be maded and this was the final result. In order to see the result / compare both all you have to do 
is clone this repository and open the folder with VS CODE, it could be other editor, i mentioned this one for being more popular.

This project was built from scratch based on my last 6 months HTML and CSS experience, it will updated gradually for the reason that i'm learning other technologies
such as JS, REACT and ANGULAR. Thanks for your time and comment if you liked the new features.
